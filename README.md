# 🌀 Flow Matching on 2D Toy Data

This project demonstrates Flow Matching on a 2D toy problem (Gaussian to Checkerboard). It includes:
- Training with synthetic data
- Learned velocity field visualizations
- Sample trajectories and final outputs
- Limitations and extensions of the method

## 📓 Contents
- `flow_matching.ipynb`: main notebook
- `images/`: optional visualizations for the README
- `requirements.txt`: dependencies

## 🛠️ Setup
```bash
